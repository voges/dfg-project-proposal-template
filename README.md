# DFG Project Proposal Template

_A minimalist LaTeX template for DFG project proposals_

For all those of you who want to write a DFG Project Proposal, but feel that [RTF](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format), Word, or Google Docs won't do the job.

This template is based on [DFG form 53.01 elan](https://www.dfg.de/de/foerderung/antrag-foerderprozess/formulare-merkblaetter) "Project Description - Project Proposal [09/22]", with a few sensible changes:
- No header
- Page numbers at the bottom center
- LaTeX's default font sizes for headings (instead of using Arial 11 pt for everything)

This template works with XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX as compiler.

This is intentionally a minimal viable product.
For a more sophisticated, but also more complex start, there is [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/dfg-research-grants-programme-proposal-template/xbbjqskssjxq) by [Johannes KÃ¶ster](https://johanneskoester.bitbucket.io).
